While existing scholarship has treated the passage through the interior as a backdrop to the rebellion, I focus on the interior regions themselves, exploring how the country's so-called \u201cbacklands\" served as both a place and a concept in the formation of modern Brazil. By analyzing the rebel passage through the interior and also the meanings attached to that experience afterwards, I will chart the Column's political, conceptual, and geographic significance throughout the twentieth century.My study of the Prestes Column will also serve to develop an entirely new subfield: interior history, an innovative approach for studying Brazil and also Latin America as a whole.",

Lesser known are his utopian residential experiments conducted at the intentional communities, or ashrams, that he founded in South Africa and India: Phoenix Settlement (est. 1904), Tolstoy Farm (est. 1910), Sabarmati Ashram (est. 1915), and Sevagram Ashram (est. 1936). Residents engaged in small-scale experiments with ideals and methods for living a just life that Gandhi would apply to larger-scale social, religious, and political problems. This book focuses on the communal observances undertaken by Gandhi and his co-residents to illuminate the evolution of Gandhi\u2019s concept of sarvodaya, universal wellbeing. It argues: First, that voluntary self-control, which at times bled into self-sacrifice, was central to Gandhi\u2019s utopian philosophy of sarvodaya; and second, that Gandhi\u2019s intentional communities were the necessary conditions for his experiments with and articulation of that philosophy.",

My research reveals that southern commercial banks accepted slaves as collateral for loans, helped underwrite the sale of slaves, and sold slave property as part of foreclosure proceedings. Commercial bank involvement with slavery occurred throughout the antebellum period and across the South, placing southern banks at the heart of the domestic slave trade. This project will result in the first major monograph on the relationship between banking and slavery, as well as serving as a corrective to the conclusions of several scholars collectively called the \u201cnew historians of capitalism.\u201d Most banks limited their direct involvement with slavery, demonstrating that capitalism did not need slavery to develop.

The Limits of Life explores the cultural and scientific world of advanced old age in early modern Europe (1450-1700). While many in this period were particularly intrigued by the possibility of extending human life, physicians and natural philosophers were also deeply concerned about the political, philosophical, ecological, and social implications of longevity. Expanding beyond the historical demography of Renaissance Italy, my research builds on recent scholarship interested in the cultural and medical history of death and dying. My research probes the ways that ideas about mortality and longevity crossed between elite spaces and popular discourse both in print and through well-documented encounters with the bodies of the aged. Longevity, as both a goal and a lived reality, revealed the religious, social, and embodied limits of early modern life.",

Reformer Julia Ward Howe, psychoanalyst Helene Deutsch, and gynecologist Sophia Kleegman communicated from different social locations and time periods to push back against\u2014and contribute to\u2014scientific orthodoxy. I contend that the fissures they created in scholarly and mainstream discourses about reproductive health functioned to expand the scope of infertility diagnosis and treatment regimens, and to loosen long-held clinical beliefs about women as the central players in fertility related ills. This analysis identifies the discursive strategies that these actors employed to intervene in fertility studies and demonstrates how interventions in science often unfold not in terms of revolutions but in terms of multimodal, nonlinear, and longitudinal communicative negotiations.",

Despite her talents as a writer and her contributions to American\nintellectual history, there is no critical biography of this important author:\n\"Elizabeth Stuart Phelps: The Woman Who Invented Heaven\" will correct\nthis oversight. Drawing on archival research and published histories, the\nbiography will introduce Phelps to a general audience, locating her life and\nworks in a rich account of US culture, and provide scholars with a synthetic\naccount of this prominent figure in American literary history.",

This project questions this perception through a study of the Iberian realms of Le\u00f3n, Galicia, and Castile in the eleventh century, under Fernando I (1037-65) and Queen Sancha (d. 1067); it will be the first study of the reign in English. The period is often seen as one in which their Christian kingdom gained the upper hand over the weaker Islamic states of al-Andalus. Historians have generally believed that Fernando aspired to imperial authority in Iberia, developed a close relationship with the French monastic order of Cluny, and exerted dominance over the Islamic states to the south. This project challenges all these presumptions. Through an original analysis of royal charters and narrative sources, it traces the pragmatic nature of power and a geopolitical environment in which religious identity was by no means paramount.",

The \u201ctraffic in women\u201d generated copious documentation on such themes as border policing, passport controls, immigration law, deportation, and repatriation. In addition, letters written by ostensibly trafficked women, their families, and members of criminal networks reveal the lived experience of these migrations. Focusing primarily on the transatlantic route between France and the Americas, the project situates both the discourse and experience of early twentieth-century trafficking within a longer history of free and unfree labor, sex work, mobility, and globalization. It thereby deepens our understanding of human trafficking, one of the most visible and controversial human rights issues of our time.",

It  explores how post-revolutionary thinkers (A. de Tocqueville, V. Cousin, F. Guizot, C. de R\u00e9musat, liberal Catholics, \u00c9. Laboulaye, and J. Ferry) used the legacy of the French Revolution to build new representative institutions and promote key reforms, most notably in the field of education. The project also addresses several important contemporary concerns. I argue that far from being of mere historical interest, moderation is particularly relevant in an eclectic age such as ours, because it can also serve as a powerful normative stance in the fight against new forms of political extremism and religious fundamentalism.",

Queen Mother\u201d Audley Moore: Mother of Black Nationalism is the first full length biography of Moore\u2014one of the most influential yet understudied activists and thinkers of the 20th century. The book examines Moore\u2019s life and activism from the 1890s until her death in 1997 and argues that she was an important but overlooked progenitor of 20th century black radical thought whose organizing approaches and ideas became the architecture of modern radical black activism.

Despite its popularity among Jewish readership of the pre-modern era and being generally considered a milestone in the history of Hebrew literary culture, it has never been translated into English, nor has it been the subject of thorough scholarly investigation in English.

Part of a ceremonial district erected by Mississippian Mound Builders hundreds of years earlier, it was the largest of over two dozen mounds that gave the city its early claim to fame. During the 1800s, all\u2014except one outlier\u2014were razed. This project explores the life, death, and afterlife of the mounds, revealing their significance for both Indian and non-Indian peoples. It examines both the literal destruction of Indian cultural artifacts and the narrative erasure of Indian peoples in histories of the city\u2019s development.
